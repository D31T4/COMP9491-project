Directions:

1. Run preprocessing_tocsv.py to populate the datasets/train_val_no_split folder
2. Run preprocessing_train_val_split.py to take the data in datasets/train_val_no_split and split it into the following
4 folders:

    - datasets/Tianjin
    - datasets/Tianjin_1
    - datasets/Tianjin_2
    - datasets/Tianjin_3

The following datasets have been implemented.

1. Baseline SIND Dataset (Tianjin folder)
    - Baseline established for SIND dataset
    - Parameters controlled in main function:
        - {'name': 'Tianjin', 'train_ratio': 0.7, 'val_ratio': 0.2, 'seed': 42},

2. Vulnerable participants dataset (Tianjin_1 folder)
    - Filter added to include only vulnerable participants in the test set.
    - Vulnerable participants are defined as class 0, 4, 5 and 6.

3. Nullified traffic encoder (Tianjin_2 folder)
    - Filter added to nullify the traffic signal encoder in the test set.
    - Traffic signal encoder is defined as class 1. All signals for the encoder set to 0 (i.e. red) across all data sets
    - Traffic signal corresponds to last row (encoded_traffic_signal) in the dataset


Notes on data:

- Output should have the following 12 columns (in order)

frame_id
track_id
x
y
vx
vy
ax
ay
length
width
agent_type
encoded_traffic_signal
